      The set doesn't leave much to the imagination as it contains just a mask, some rags over the shoulders, a waistwrap, and bracelets. It leaves the user's chest, arms, and legs exposed.That doesn't make it useless, though. It provides plenty of damage negation and other resistances. If an Elden Ring player wants to wear this scandalous armor set, they need to complete the questline given by Brother Corhyn.`,

      content: `n a bid to make headways in the highly-competitive laptop market in the country dominated by the likes of HP, Lenovo and Dell, tech giant Samsung has now brought laptops to the country, including the affordable Galaxy Book Go.With a starting price of Rs 38,990, the Galaxy Book Go comes in silver colour and features a 14-inch display.
      It is powered by a Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 processor and comes with 4GB RAM.
      
      Let us find out how the new Galaxy Book Go performed in our review.
      
      In terms of design, the Samsung Galaxy Book Go has an all-plastic build, but it still feels robust, and the silver colour scheme makes it appear more premium than it is with a sleek design.
      
      To accommodate the webcam, the bezels are small on the sides and broader on the top.
      
      There are two USB Type-C ports, one on each side. On the left side, there is also a 3.5mm audio jack and a microSD card slot. The two 1.5W speakers are placed on the bottom and they support Dolby Atmos.
      
      The 14-inch full HD display on this laptop is large for a laptop at this price point, but it has some flaws. We noticed a little bit colour distortion while looking from different angles at times

      content: `After scoring a spectacular record of entering the 400 Crore Club, KGF: Chapter 2 [Hindi] has continued its onwards journey by going past the 5 crores mark again. The film brought in 5.75 crores* more, which is a good improvement over the numbers that it had fetched the day before [3.85 crores]. Friday was it as it is quite good and now with Saturday showing further jump in numbers, there is a clear indication that the film is not done as yet and it has a few more weeks where it will continue to perform in a rather uninterrupted manner.
      The Yash starrer currently stands at 407.55 crores* and now the next big milestone in sight is 415 crores. It has to be seen whether the jump today would be a big enough that this feat would be accomplished before the close of weekend itself. Considering the fact that there is no new Hindi film in the running currently, KGF: Chapter 2 [Hindi] has the field wide open to go out there and entice footfalls by the dozen.`,

        `Amjad Khan's son Shadaab Khan is our guest for this Sunday's #BigInterview. Shadaab rewinds on the shocking days when he reached with the required medicine just seconds after his father died, his rage thereafter and the subsequent struggle that he and his mother and siblings faced as many producers didn't pay Amjad Khan.
        Of course, we also spoke to him about Amjad Khan's super stardom. Those were the days! Aaj kal toh villain film mein hai bhi ya nahin, woh pata bhi nahi chalta (You seldom understand in today's films whether a villain exists or not). 'Sholay' (1975) flagged it off with an unforgettable performance for that man and a long list of films followed thereafter.`,
